# Machine-Learning-with-Python

Machine Learning (ML) is basically that field of computer science with the help of which computer systems can provide sense to data in much the same way as human beings do. In simple words, ML is a type of artificial intelligence that extract patterns out of raw data by using an algorithm or method. The key focus of ML is to allow computer systems to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed or human intervention.

ML algorithms:

1]classification:  
  a. logistic regression              
  b. support vector machine 
  c. decision tree                       
  d. bayes 
  e. random forest 
  
2]Regression
  a. linear regression
  
3]clustering :
  a.  k-mean
  b. mean shift 
  c. hierarchical
  
4]KNN algo(k nearest neighbours):
  finding nearest negihbors
